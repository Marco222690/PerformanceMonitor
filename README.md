## 📋 What is PerformanceMonitor?

PerformanceMonitor is a free and open-source tool designed to help you keep an eye on your SQL Server’s health and speed. Whether you run a large server setup or just want to check one database on your computer, PerformanceMonitor gives you clear information about how well your system is doing.

It comes in two versions:

- **Full Edition:** This version is installed on a server and can check up to 30 different parts (collectors) of your SQL Server's performance.
- **Lite Edition:** A smaller version you can run by itself on your PC using DuckDB, a simple database engine.

PerformanceMonitor also includes a built-in MCP server that can work with AI for advanced data analysis. But you don't need to know anything about AI to use the basic features.

## ⚙️ How to Use PerformanceMonitor

Once open, you’ll see a simple dashboard showing your SQL Server performance status.
